# LCD Game
## Introduction

For this lab, we were given multiple demo files and we were supposed to
understand it to be able to create our own toy. Our toy is required to have a
shape to either move or change with buttons, have some sort of sound
implemented, and have it go to sleep and wake up after a while.

## My LCD Game

For my game I created a rectangle that you are able to mover around, even out
of bounds, and it will eventually go back onto screen, while having a
background song playing through out the whole game. The first button is used
to move the rectangle left, the second is used to move the rectangle up, the
third is to move the rectangle down, and the fourth is to move the rectangle
down. The LCD game would end up falling asleep after aproximately 10
secconds. I was having trouble with making the msp430 wakeing up again after
having it go back to sleep. The song that is playing in the background is
called "coffin dance".

## Running game

To run the game you do "make final"
